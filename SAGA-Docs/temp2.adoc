= Notification Service Role

*What It Does:*
- Receives events from Axon Server (PaymentSettledEvent, PaymentRejectedEvent, etc.)
- Sends notifications (email, SMS, push notifications)
- Logs notifications to database for audit trail
- Provides REST APIs to query notification status

*What It Does NOT Do:*
- Does NOT publish events back to Axon Server
- Does NOT trigger other services
- Does NOT participate in command/query flow

*Event Flow Architecture*


----
REST API → Authorization Service → Axon Server
    ↓
PaymentInitiatedEvent → Authorization Service
    ↓  
PaymentAuthorizedEvent → Settlement Service
    ↓
PaymentSettledEvent → Notification Service (TERMINAL)
    ↓
[Email/SMS sent] → END
----

*Why This Design Makes Sense*
- Single Responsibility: Notification service only handles notifications
- No Side Effects: Sending notifications shouldn't trigger business logic
- Audit Trail: Notifications are logged but don't affect payment flow
- Resilience: If notification fails, payment is still complete

*NotificationSentEvent (Alternative - NOT implemented)*

- Could publish NotificationSentEvent for tracking
- Could trigger analytics service
* Could update customer communication preferences
* Adds complexity but provides more observability
